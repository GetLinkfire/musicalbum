Kubernetes
Local or cloud kubernetes cluster

# Requirements:
Use dotnet core.
You are allowed to use any technology/third party you would like to use.
Solution should be testable, we are not looking for 100% code coverage but show examples of how you make parts unit-testable.
We want to get a better understanding of:
The code you produce
How do you go about architecting a scalable solution!


# Notes:
We would like to see a piece of code as you would do on your normal working day.
